# Dependencies folder installed by npm
node_modules/

# Environment file containing secrets (like DB connection strings)
.env

# Other common ignore files for Node.js
dist
build
npm-debug.log


### Why we do this:

* **`node_modules/`:** This folder contains hundreds of thousands of files downloaded by `npm install`. It is huge and unnecessary to track in Git, as anyone can regenerate it by simply running `npm install`.
* **`.env`:** This file holds your MongoDB password and JWT secret. **You should never commit secrets to Git** (especially not to a public repo). Ignoring it keeps your application secure.

### What's Next?

With the `.env` file secured and your `MONGO_URI` ready (from the previous step), you are now ready to **start the API server and connect to MongoDB!**

1.  Navigate back to your backend project folder (`expense-flow-api`).
2.  Run the command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

Once you see **`MongoDB connected successfully!`** in your terminal, we can immediately move to testing the **Admin Signup** to generate the first company and user!
